This is a project I created to learn more about low-level programming and delve into the world of compilers. The goal is to create a simple programming language that can be compiled to WebAssembly.

You may look at the code and think the means to my desired end are incorrect and/or inefficient. That's not a bug, but a feature, as they say in San Francisco. I'm doing this to learn and mess around, so I won't hesitate to break stuff if it means I'll learn something new.
